        <p>The island of Cuba was inhabited by various Amerindian cultures prior to the arrival of the explorer Christopher Columbus in 1492.<br>
        After his arrival, Spain conquered Cuba and appointed Spanish governors to rule in Havana.<br>
        The administrators in Cuba were subject to the Viceroy of New Spain and the local authorities in Hispaniola.<br>
        In 1762–63, Havana was briefly occupied by Britain, before being returned to Spain in exchange for Florida.<br>
        A series of rebellions between 1868 and 1898, led by General Máximo Gómez, failed to end Spanish rule and claimed the lives of 49,000 Cuban guerrillas and 126,000 Spanish soldiers.[1]<br>
        However, the Spanish–American War resulted in a Spanish withdrawal from the island in 1898, and following three-and-a-half years of subsequent US military rule,[2] Cuba gained formal independence in 1902.[3]<br>
        In the years following its independence, the Cuban republic saw significant economic development, but also political corruption and a succession of despotic leaders, culminating in the overthrow of the dictator Fulgencio Batista by the 26th of July Movement, led by Fidel Castro, during the 1953–1959 Cuban Revolution.[4]<br>
        The new government aligned with the Soviet Union and embraced communism.[a]<br>
        In the early 1960s, Castro's regime withstood invasion, faced nuclear Armageddon,[b] and experienced a civil war that included Dominican support for regime opponents.[c]<br>
        Following the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia (1968), Castro publicly declared Cuba's support.</p>
